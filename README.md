# 🧠 Job Interview Preparation — Machine Learning Specialist Workshop

## 📘 Overview
This package contains study materials and notebooks created to prepare for a **Junior Machine Learning Specialist** interview. It demonstrates summarization, coverage analysis, assessment via quiz, and targeted reinforcement by generating a custom workshop notebook.

The workflow demonstrates the ability to:
1. Interpret and summarize machine learning materials.  
2. Identify learning gaps.  
3. Generate interview-style assessments.  
4. Translate quiz results into targeted learning exercises.

## 🎯 Activity Objectives

1. **Summarize Learning Content**
   - Produce a 500-word synthesis of the main ML concepts across workshops.
   - Generate a 100-word professional study guide summary.

2. **Evaluate Coverage**
   - Match study materials against key learning topics.
   - Identify and report coverage gaps (if any).

3. **Interactive Assessment**
   - Complete a 15-question multiple-choice quiz.
   - Obtain a personalized score report.

4. **Targeted Reinforcement**
   - Automatically generate a **new workshop notebook** (`JobInterviewGuide_Workshop.ipynb`)
     addressing misunderstood topics with:
     - Explanatory Markdown sections.
     - Scaffolded Python exercises.
     - Solutions reference in `JobInterviewGuide_Solutions.ipynb`.
     - Quiz Recap and Glossary Table for final review.
